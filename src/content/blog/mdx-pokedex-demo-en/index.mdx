# MDX in Action: Stuffing a Pokédex into a Blog Post

One day I decided I wanted an interactive Pokédex inside a blog post.

A normal person would think: that's impossible, Markdown is just plain text.

Then I discovered MDX.

## What Is MDX

MDX = Markdown + JSX.

Simply put, you can write React components directly inside a `.mdx` file, like this:

```mdx
# This is a normal article

Some content...

<MyComponent client:load />

More content...
```

The rest is handled by Astro. It renders the Markdown as HTML and hydrates the React components into interactive islands.

## See It in Action

I wrote a Pokédex component, then called it here:

```mdx
import Pokedex from '../../../components/Pokedex';

<Pokedex client:load />
```

Just those two lines. Then, after a *tiny bit* of tweaking —

<Pokedex client:load />

Multilingual search in Chinese, English, Japanese, and Spanish. 18 type filters. Debounced queries. Pagination.

("Tiny bit.")

## What Does `client:load` Mean

Astro runs zero client-side JS by default. To bring a React component to life, you need a hydration directive:

| Directive | Timing | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `client:load` | Immediately on load | Needs interaction right away (like a Pokédex) |
| `client:idle` | When the browser is idle | Low-priority widgets |
| `client:visible` | When scrolled into view | Components lower on the page |
| `client:only="react"` | Client-only, skips SSR | Components that need browser APIs |

The Pokédex starts fetching data as soon as the page loads, so `client:load` it is.

## One Gotcha with Imports

Inside MDX, imports must use **relative paths** — path aliases won't work:

```mdx
✅ import Pokedex from '../../../components/Pokedex';
❌ import Pokedex from '@/components/Pokedex';
```

Astro resolves MDX at build time, and aliases may not be available at that stage. A few extra `../` never hurt anyone.

## Wrapping Up

MDX in one sentence: **write React inside Markdown, write Markdown inside React**.

As for the PokeAPI GraphQL calls, the multilingual mappings, the debounced search… those are all part of the "tiny bit" of tweaking. Not important.

What matters is that my blog post now has a Pokédex.

That's the only thing that truly matters.
